# miniproject4SGabel

This project would have been another website that would have stored data for the bot.
I did not have enough time to make it, unfortunately, so the code is basically just a partially
completed husk of the Django tutorial. Unfortunately it is unable to reach the polls section of the code, and
I truly do not know why.

### To install requirements, use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To start the server, run the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
